This repository contains the project "goit-markup-hw-08" hosted on GitHub Pages. It is a website built as part of the GoIT HTML/CSS course. The project focuses on implementing responsive web design techniques using HTML, CSS (Sass/SCSS), and optimizing images for retina displays.

## Features

- Responsive design: The website is designed to be accessible and visually appealing on different devices and screen sizes, including desktop and mobile devices.
- Semantic HTML: The project uses semantic HTML tags to enhance accessibility and provide meaning to the structure of the web page.

- Retina-ready images: The images used in the project are optimized for retina displays, ensuring they appear crisp and clear on high-density screens.
- Form integration: The project includes a contact form with proper form validation.
